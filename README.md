**Spam filtering**

Spam Filter using Naive Bayes
This program uses scikit-learn for the machine learning pipeline and a mock dataset to demonstrate the core steps:

**Data Preparation**: Loading a dataset of messages and their labels (spam/ham).

**Text Preprocessing**: Converting text into a numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), a sophisticated version of the Bag-of-Words model.

**Model Training**: Training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

**Evaluation**: Testing the model's ability to distinguish between spam and ham.
